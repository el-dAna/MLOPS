Problem 2
Pattern in each input is periodic every 6 rows
It persists for 1.5 period(6 rows) and stops
The output continues to complete the revolution by adding the next 3 rows based on the period/pattern

Probem 3
Dimention of input and output same so it is easy to compare pixels
All pixels seem to keep original position except 'last piece' of every shape
shift last piece left by 1 unit to solve it

Probem 4
Some i/o dimention
seed pattern of a different colour
crumb seeds placed next to seed pattern of different coulor (no colour info needed to solve puzzle)
complete crumb seed according to build full seed pattern
repeat until the dimention gets exhausted
Recognise that crums at an angle should be completed according at that angle. check sample 3


1. Recognise the difference/similarity in dimention between input/output(note the difference)
1. Recognise the position of clours in the input
2. Look at the output to determine the output
3. Does the output change in dimention, colour, 
Does input and output have similar pattern of boxes? if so find the pattern
3. Find a 'momentary'/'local' pattern between input and output


The Problem with traditional supervised learning is that input and outputs all come from the same
distribution so it makes sense to give input and ask model to predict an output and overtime with many 
examples it can hopefully generalise to fit the function.
Every Problem of this challenge is different, there is no single distribution(whether a superposition of several unique functions or not)
from which a model needs to generalise to. So it makes no sense to give it labels and ask it to predict
output.

It would be best to have a model which takes in both input and output and then try to figure it out.
Given that inputs and outputs for a Problem set come from the same distribution, a robust model should 
be able to find the momentary pattern between the given inputs to outputs.

So the model i will develop will take both inputs and outputs.
